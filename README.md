# 📘 Obsidian Bible: Insert bibleverses with ease
![Obsidian Bible referencing logo](assets/img/ObsidianBible-Overview.png)

🔗 **Obsidian Bible** is a custom integration for Obsidian, the Markdown-based note-taking app that I've grown to love. This extension allows me to seamlessly connect my notes with verses from the Bible, making my research and study sessions more meaningful and efficient. 🔗

> Why another obsidian integration
> Other bible-apis only feature a few selected german / english bibles, most of the time, not the ones I use regularily. Therefore this integration is built upon the "YouVersion - Bible.com" website. Therefore theoretically all on the website available bibles can be used.
